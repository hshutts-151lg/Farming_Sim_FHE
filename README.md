# Farming Simulator with Secret Crop Genetics ðŸŒ¾

This project is an innovative farming simulator where players engage in crop management and breeding new plants, powered by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**. As players crossbreed plants, the genetic informationâ€”including yield potential and resistance traitsâ€”is securely encrypted, allowing for exciting discoveries in a playful and engaging environment.

## The Problem We Address

In traditional farming simulators, players often face limitations regarding the security and privacy of their crop genetics. In a competitive gaming landscape, players need to protect their unique plant varieties from being copied or exploited. Furthermore, the complexity of understanding genetic traits can deter players from fully engaging with the farming experience.

## The FHE Advantage

Utilizing Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology, we solve these problems by ensuring that crop genetics remain confidential and secure. With FHE, players can conduct calculations on encrypted data without ever exposing the underlying genetic information. This is accomplished through Zamaâ€™s open-source libraries, making our implementation robust and scalable, while also empowering players to explore the genetic potential of their crops without fear of theft or misuse.

## Core Features

- **Encrypted Crop Genetics**: All crop genetic sequences are encrypted using Zama's FHE technology, ensuring privacy throughout the breeding process.
- **Homomorphic Calculations**: The results of crossbreeding can be computed on encrypted data, maintaining confidentiality while integrating game mechanics.
- **Exploration and Discovery**: Players can discover superior crop varieties through strategy and observation, encouraging investment in genetic exploration.
- **Tradeable Genetic Assets**: Exceptional crop varieties can be held as encrypted assets, allowing players to trade them securely within the game economy.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama's FHE SDK** - The primary tool for confidential computing and managing encrypted data.
- **Node.js** - For backend development and server-side functionality.
- **Hardhat** - A development environment for Ethereum software.
- **Solidity** - For smart contract development.

â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Installation Instructions

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or later) installed on your machine.
   - Install Hardhat by following the official documentation.

2. **Setup Steps**:
   - Download the project files (do not use `git clone`).
   - Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
   - Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   This command will fetch the required Zama FHE libraries along with other dependencies.

## Build & Run Guide

After installation, you can compile and test the project using the following commands:

1. **Compile Contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run Tests**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Start Development Environment**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
   ```
   This will deploy the smart contracts and initialize the game environment.

### Example Code Snippet

Here's a brief code snippet demonstrating how to perform a homomorphic calculation on crop genetics:

```javascript
const { EncryptCrop, Crossbreed } = require('./fheOperations');

async function breedCrops(parent1, parent2) {
    const encryptedParent1 = await EncryptCrop(parent1);
    const encryptedParent2 = await EncryptCrop(parent2);

    const encryptedOffspring = Crossbreed(encryptedParent1, encryptedParent2);
    return encryptedOffspring;
}

// Example usage
const newGeneticTrait = await breedCrops(cropA, cropB);
console.log('New Offspring Genetic Trait:', newGeneticTrait);
```
